# Sky Bound

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sky Bound is a 3D game inspired by "Only Up!", developed using Unreal Engine 5. The game features immersive environments and challenging gameplay, encouraging players to climb their way to the top. However, one wrong step can mean losing all progress, adding an intense level of difficulty and excitement.<br />

## Overview
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sky Bound was created as a hands-on project to deepen my understanding of Unreal Engine 5. This journey allowed me to explore the engineâ€™s powerful tools and plugins, focusing on building immersive environments and integrating various assets.


## Features
- **Immersive 3D Environments**: Traverse through stunningly arranged objects and landscapes that present unique and extraordinary challenges.
- **Integrated Assets**: Utilized high-quality plugins from the Unreal Engine asset store, including:
  - **Advanced Locomotion System**: For smooth and realistic character movement.
  - **Sky and Texture Assets**: To enhance visual quality and create captivating, atmospheric environments.
- **Custom 3D Models**: Crafted multiple original 3D models to populate the game world, adding a personal touch to the gameâ€™s design.

## Development Goals
- **Unreal Engine 5 Proficiency**: The primary goal was to gain familiarity with Unreal Engine's interface, tools, and capabilities.
- **Asset Integration and Plugin Experimentation**: Explored various Unreal Engine Marketplace plugins to understand their functionality and effective integration.
- **3D Modeling Practice**: Created custom 3D models to enhance the gameâ€™s environment and refine my modeling skills.
